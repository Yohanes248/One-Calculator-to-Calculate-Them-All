# One Calculator to Calculate Them All  
## Description  

This Python-based calculator is crafted to assist Sauron, the dark lord from *The Lord of the Rings*, in executing his grand plan of forging magical rings of power. Tasked with creating the infamous **One Ring** and several **Rings of Power**, Sauron relies on precision and efficiency to ensure the process meets his exacting standards.  

The tool is designed to:  
- **Calculate Ring Dimensions and Volumes**: By taking user inputs, it determines the dimensions of the rings, including their outer diameter, height, and the inner cutout. It calculates both the raw and usable volumes of the rings.  
- **Handle Unit Conversions**: Since materials are sold in cubic inches while measurements are provided in the metric system, the calculator performs precise unit conversions, ensuring accuracy down to the last millimeter.  
- **Determine Material Requirements**: The tool computes the total material volume needed for the rings and rounds up to the nearest whole cubic inch, as partial cubes cannot be purchased.  
- **Estimate Costs**: It calculates the total cost of materials and forging for both the **Rings of Power** and the **One Ring**, factoring in different material costs and a tripled forging cost for the One Ring.  

This project ensures a seamless workflow for Sauron by automating these calculations...
